With the help of Gen AI, we support mental health professionals by creating chatbots that can provide personalized therapy sessions and coping strategies to individuals experiencing stress and anxiety.
When you visit the website, a chatbot engages with you in real-time through a conversational interface. You'll see a chat widget or pop-up inviting you to start a conversation. Just type your questions, and the chatbot, equipped with NLP, will understand your intent and provide personalized responses. It offers assistance, answers FAQs, recommends products, and can even provide support based on your preferences. As it learns from interactions, it continuously improves, ensuring you receive the best support. If needed, it can connect you to a health professional for complex queries. Enjoy a seamless and interactive experience with the website chatbot at your service.
